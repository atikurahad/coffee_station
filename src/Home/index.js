        Coffee processing refers to the way that a seed is removed from a coffee
        cherry. Like any other pitted fruit, coffee cherries have a seed, the
        pulp, the mucilage around the seed, and a protective skin. There are
        various methods to remove the seed from that cherry, and these methods
        affect the seed's flavor as it gets roasted and turned into a coffee
        beanâ€”this flavor sticks around till the final brew.
